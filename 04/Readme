WARNING:
as Mike Johanson likes to remind us,
it's not clear whether the illegal move was
due to Mongoose or operator error;
we were never able to duplicate the illegal move.

Warning:
the game six logs are misleading, as explained below.
I handtranslated the file six6 
to show that Mongoose started and six swapped;
the game logs show six as starting, without the swap.

Hi,

>first in the sixth, and last, game in Israel?
>the sixth game should have been started by Mongoose.

We restarted the game a few times.

First YL played a3, f6, e6 and it looked like Six would repeat the loss =
from the previous round. Because the operator of Six did not know how to =
prevent this, I offered out of sportsmanship to play a different =
opening. Six had already won the tournament and the result of this game =
would not make a different. Also, playing a different opening would be =
more informative for us in future analysis.

We restarted the game but now with Mongoose playing b2 and Six swapping. =
However, we accidentally played using the wrong swap-rule mode for Six, =
so the programs were both playing towards the same side on the board.

So we had to restart the game again.

Mongoose started with b2 and Six swapped, but it seems to me that =
instead of entering Swap as move into the program, I simply let the =
program respond as a second player.


>2) is the Israel version of Mongoose in CVS?
>if so, could you please remind me how to access it?

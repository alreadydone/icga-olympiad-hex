game 2: both programs saw White's score drop shortly after move 12.W[e8].
then each player saw their scores rise, until around move 44 when
White saw that it was in trouble.

pondering helped mohex, predicted many moves

for the most part, the programs were evenly matched...
except occasionally ezo would play a move that mohex did not
think was the best move, and then ezo's score would drop a bit...
mohex's value (average minimax) seems surprisingly robust

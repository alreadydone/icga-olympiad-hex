\section{The Tournaments}
The 2016 Olympiad included
two Hex tournaments: 11$\times$11 and 13$\times$13.
Three programs competed in the 11$\times$11 tournament:
\Eo{} by Kei Takada, supervised by Masahito Yamamoto, from Japan;
\Hz{} by Tianli Zhang, operated by Yunxiao Sun, from China; and
\Mx{} 2.0 \citebay{HAHMP13}, 
by Broderick Arneson, Ryan Hayward, Philip Henderson, Aja Huang, and Jakub Pawlewicz, from Canada.

Three programs competed in the 13$\times$13 tournament:
\Eo{}, \Hz{}, and \Mt{} from Canada,
with the same authors as \Mx{}, plus Noah Weninger and Kenny Young.

\Eo{} is a stronger version of the program that competed in the 2015 Olympiad.
\Eo{} is based on the Benzene framework and uses iterative deepening depth-first search with an evaluation function based on a weighted combination of some network connectivity measures.
\Eo{} ran on an i7 laptop and uses Benzene's 
Depth-First Proof Number Search solver.

\Hz{} is a new program?  by ?  

\Mx{}, the winner of the previous five Olympiad Hex competitions
\citebay{HAHP13},
is an MCTS program that uses the Benzene Hex framework
built on the code base of \Fuego\ \citebay{fuego},
the Go program developed by Martin M\"{u}ller, Markus Enzenberger
and others at the University of Alberta.
Benzene allows virtual connection and
inferior cell computations.
\Mx{} performs these computations in UCT tree nodes visited at least 256 times.
\Mx{} ran on a 24 core shared-memory machine, 
with 4 cores reserved for the 
Depth-First Proof Number Search solver, which
produces perfect play if it solves the
position within the time allotted for a move.
\Mx{} uses a book ---
built by Broderick Arneson using Thomas Lincke's method 
\citebay{DBLP:conf/cg/Lincke00} ---
with two 11$\times$11 openings.

\Mt{} is a new hybrid program that combines
the \Mx{} MCTS search tree with a 
depth-1 tree created by calling \Nx{}, 
a Deep Convolution Neural Net, once from the root.

TODO cite Nx paper.

Each tournament was a three-player double round robin, so 12 games
in total with 8 games per player.
Post-game win-detection is by our solver.

\section{Conclusions}
%{\large\bf Conclusions}
%\Eo{}'s performance was stronger than its record indicates. 
%It played some strong openings and had winning moves deep
%into games against \Dx.
%It was unlucky not to win a game.

%\Dx\ and \Mx\ were evenly matched, but play different styles.
%\Mx\ seems stronger in opening and early middle play,
%but its Monte Carlo simulations cannot handle tactical positions.
%\Dx\ thrives on tactical positions, and is especially
%strong in the late middle game in complicated positions.

\section{The Tournaments}
The 2016 Olympiad included
two Hex tournaments: 11$\times$11 and 13$\times$13.
Three programs competed in the 11$\times$11 tournament:
\Eo{} by Kei Takada, supervised by Masahito Yamamoto, from Japan;
\Hz{} by Tianli Zhang from China; and
\Mx{} 2.0 \citebay{HAHMP13}, 
by Broderick Arneson, Ryan Hayward, Philip Henderson, Aja Huang, 
Jakub Pawlewicz, and Noah Weninger, from Canada.

Three programs competed in the 13$\times$13 tournament:
\Eo{}, \Hz{}, and \Mt{} from Canada,
with the same authors as \Mx{}, plus Kenny Young.

\Eo{} is a stronger version of the program that competed in the 2015 Olympiad.
\Eo{} is based on the Benzene framework and uses iterative deepening depth-first search with an evaluation function based on a weighted combination of some network connectivity measures \citebay{TakadaHIY15}.
\Eo{} ran on two threads of an i7 4790 laptop,
with one thread for search and one thread for
Benzene's Depth-First Proof Number Search endgame solver.

\Hz{} is a new MCTS program written by Tianli Zhang from 
Beijing Institute of Technology.

\Mx{}, the winner of the previous five Olympiad Hex competitions
\citebay{HAHP13},
is an MCTS program that uses the Benzene Hex framework
built on the code base of \Fuego\ \citebay{fuego},
the Go program developed by Martin M\"{u}ller, Markus Enzenberger
and others at the University of Alberta.
Benzene allows virtual connection and
inferior cell computations.
\Mx{} performs these computations in UCT tree nodes visited at least 256 times.
\Mx{} ran on Firecreek, a 24 core shared-memory machine, 
with 4 cores reserved for the 
Depth-First Proof Number Search solver \citebay{PawlH13}, which
produces perfect play if it solves the
position within the time allotted for a move.
\Mx{} uses a book ---
built by Broderick Arneson with Thomas Lincke's method 
\citebay{DBLP:conf/cg/Lincke00}
and expanded by Noah Weninger ---
with eight 11$\times$11 openings.

\Mt{} is a new hybrid program that combines
the \Mx{} MCTS search tree with a 
depth-1 tree created by calling \Nx{}, 
a Deep Convolution Neural Net \citebay{YoungVH16}, once from the root.

Each tournament was a three-player double round robin, so 12 games
in total with 8 games per player.
Post-game win-detection is by our solver.
%Tony van der Walk contributed to this commentary.

{\large\bf 11$\times$11 Tournament}

The tournament comprised two double round robins.
Round 1 took place on June 27, Round 2 on June 28.
The last two games were not played,
as the outcome had already been decided.

\hline 11x11 results &\Mx{} &\Eo{}  & \Hz{}  & total & result \\ 
\hline \Mx{}         &      &  4-0  &  3-0   & 7-0  &  gold \\

After the tournament, \Eo\ and \Mx\ played two games on similar
hardware, each with one thread for the search and one for the solver.
They each won one game.

\section{Conclusions}
%{\large\bf Conclusions}
%\Eo{}'s performance was stronger than its record indicates. 
%It played some strong openings and had winning moves deep
%into games against \Dx.
%It was unlucky not to win a game.

%\Dx\ and \Mx\ were evenly matched, but play different styles.
%\Mx\ seems stronger in opening and early middle play,
%but its Monte Carlo simulations cannot handle tactical positions.
%\Dx\ thrives on tactical positions, and is especially
%strong in the late middle game in complicated positions.
